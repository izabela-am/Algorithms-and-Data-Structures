# Hash Table
A Hash Table structure written in C

wil update this README with a lengthy explanation of how a Hash Table works. Am doing this to study for an upcoming Algorithms and Data Structures III exam

The command: 
cc src/main.c src/hash_table.c src/prime.c -o ht
will produce an executable called ht which you can run.
